The objective of this project is to build a reliable machine learning system for predicting used car prices. Real-world car listing data was collected and transformed into a structured tabular format. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to understand feature distributions, detect skewness, and analyze correlations among numerical variables.
Data preprocessing included handling missing values, removing extreme outliers using IQR-based filtering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
Multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting were trained and evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.
Tree-based ensemble models performed better due to their ability to capture non-linear relationships and handle skewed data. 
The best-performing model was selected and deployed using Streamlit, enabling interactive price prediction based on user inputs. 
This project demonstrates an end-to-end applied machine learning workflow with practical relevance.
